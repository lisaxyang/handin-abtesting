          This project is a practice in analyzing statistical data, categorical
          and quatitative, from two versions of a website. 
          <br>
          In this project, a simple website was chosen to model an online 
          cacti store. 
          Two versions of the website were available to the public, with a 50%
          chance of loading either version after navigating to the 
          <a href="https://studio5.herokuapp.com/" 
          target="_blank">URL</a>.
          Data from a small sample was collected using logs of user interaction
          with the website.
          <br>
          The data were parsed and cleaned to look at 2 things: 
          average time spent on the website (<b>Time to Completion</b>),
          and whether the user returned to the website or not after 
          navigating to the cart page (<b>Return Rate</b>).
          A <b>2 Sample T-test</b> and a <b>Chi-squared test</b> was conducted 
          on the data.
          The conclusions are then determined from the results of these tests.
          <br>
          I hope you enjoy reading it; a lot of love was put into this piece. &#128522;

        <h2>Website Versions</h2>
        <div class="p">
          For each website, I chose to emphasize a different aspect of the 
          shopping experience.

            <div class="p">
              In <b>version A</b>, I emphasized the process of purchasing. 
              For each item, I put the price at the top of the section in 
              very large font, and highlighted how many were already in the cart 
              to the immediate right of the item. 
              I also moved the cart to the top of the screen, so users could 
              easily see how many items were in their cart also. 
              In making these changes, I wanted the user to easily access 
              and see how much they are paying and how many items they are paying 
              for.

            <div class="p ">
              In <b>version B</b>, I emphasized the shopping experience.
              I increased the image size for all the items, increased the size 
              of the "Add to Cart" button, sort of hid the prices, and placed the 
              cart at the bottom of the page. 
              In making these changes, I wanted the user to be more immersed in the 
              items themselves and thinking about adding that item to their 
              collection when they "add to cart", and divert attention away from 
              prices and numbers.

        <h2>Hypotheses for Each Metric &#x1f9d0;</h2>
        <div class="p">
          <u>Metric 1: Time to Completion</u>
          <br> 
          Null Hypothesis: Version A will not lead to a faster time to completion 
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Alternative Hypothesis: Versiona A will lead to a faster time to 
          completion than Version B.
          <br>
          Reasoning: Version A will produce a more seamless experience with 
          the user by having the important information (cost) easily visible 
          to the average user that must work around a budget.
          <br><br>
          <u>Metric 2: Return Rate</u> 
          <br>
          Null Hypothesis: Version A will not lead to a lower return rate
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Alternative Hypothesis: Version A will lead to a lower return rate 
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Reasoning: Version A will lead to an experience that emphasizes the 
          numbers first, so users will be more conscious of their purchases
          and less likely to need to go back once they reach the cart, because 
          there should not be anything surprising to them once they reach it.

          Aside: Personally, I have always found shopping websites that 
          obscured the prices to feel almost distrustful. I would take longer 
          to try to find the price, and also would wonder if making this 
          purchase was reasonable if it feels like even the company 
          would like you to forget how much it costs.

          For this test, the link, which had an equal chance of dispalying 
          either version A or version B once clicked, was distributed 
          over two days to over 20 of my peers in the class. 
          Without knowing which version they received, they played the part 
          of a typical user and used the site to add $150 worth of cacti 
          products to their cart.
          <br>
          The data was logged through Heroku, cleaned and organized by hand, 
          and run through a Python script.

          Aside: Having access to these logs also made me realize what kind 
          of data that the websites I visit must have one me. As I'm sure 
          many people are familiar with online shopping, especially during 
          the pandemic, this made me realize what specific numbers 
          industries may be storing to gain insight on what interfaces 
          encourage their users to purchase, and to return because they had 
          a relatively seamless experience the first time.

            <li>The sample size of A/B testing is very important in finding 
              statistically significant results with small changes. 
              After running this test, I feel like I have a better understanding 
              of the advantage in resources that big industries have 
              and how much harder it must be to collect data and improve your 
              interface using A/B testing when there is low traffic to your site.
            </li>
            <li>Using statistical tests allows for a controlled method of 
              evaluating results. From the data, I would personally have guessed
              that version A had a lower return rate than version B, since 
              only 1/3 of people returned to the main page in version A but 
              1/2 of people returned to the main page in version B. However, 
              with such a small sample, the p-value was much larger than 
              0.05, and therefore I could not reject the null hypothesis.
            </li>
            <li>A/B testing reveals how metadata can be incredibly revealing 
              about users and their experience with a website. 
              For example, just seeing that the same user returned to a 
              webpage quickly after leaving, or how long it took them to 
              make their first click on the page actually reveals more than 
              normal people might expect. 
              This data is incredibly useful and powerful given how trivial 
              it may seem at first.
            </li>
          </ul>
