          This project is a practice in analyzing statistical data, categorical
          and quatitative, from two versions of a website. 
          <br>
          In this project, a simple website was chosen to model an online 
          cacti store. 
          Two versions of the website were available to the public, with a 50%
          chance of loading either version after navigating to the 
          <a href="https://studio5.herokuapp.com/" 
          target="_blank">URL</a>.
          Data from a small sample was collected using logs of user interaction
          with the website.
          <br>
          The data were parsed and cleaned to look at 2 things: 
          average time spent on the website (<b>Time to Completion</b>),
          and whether the user returned to the website or not after 
          navigating to the cart page (<b>Return Rate</b>).
          A <b>2 Sample T-test</b> and a <b>Chi-squared test</b> was conducted 
          on the data.
          The conclusions are then determined from the results of these tests.
          <br>
          I hope you enjoy reading it; a lot of love was put into this piece. &#128522;

        <h2>Website Versions</h2>
        <div class="p">
          For each website, I chose to emphasize a different aspect of the 
          shopping experience.

      <div class="section row">
          <div class="insidecol col">
            <div class="p">
              In <b>version A</b>, I emphasized the process of purchasing. 
              For each item, I put the price at the top of the section in 
              very large font, and highlighted how many were already in the cart 
              to the immediate right of the item. 
              I also moved the cart to the top of the screen, so users could 
              easily see how many items were in their cart also. 
              In making these changes, I wanted the user to easily access 
              and see how much they are paying and how many items they are paying 
              for.

            <div class="p ">
              In <b>version B</b>, I emphasized the shopping experience.
              I increased the image size for all the items, increased the size 
              of the "Add to Cart" button, sort of hid the prices, and placed the 
              cart at the bottom of the page. 
              In making these changes, I wanted the user to be more immersed in the 
              items themselves and thinking about adding that item to their 
              collection when they "add to cart", and divert attention away from 
              prices and numbers.

        <div class="p">
          <u>Metric 1: Time to Completion</u>
          <br> 
          Null Hypothesis: Version A will not lead to a faster time to completion 
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Alternative Hypothesis: Versiona A will lead to a faster time to 
          completion than Version B.
          <br>
          Reasoning: Version A will produce a more seamless experience with 
          the user by having the important information (cost) easily visible 
          to the average user that must work around a budget.
          <br><br>
          <u>Metric 2: Return Rate</u> 
          <br>
          Null Hypothesis: Version A will not lead to a lower return rate
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Alternative Hypothesis: Version A will lead to a lower return rate 
          than Version B.
          <br>
          Reasoning: Version A will lead to an experience that emphasizes the 
          numbers first, so users will be more conscious of their purchases
          and less likely to need to go back once they reach the cart, because 
          there should not be anything surprising to them once they reach it.

          Furthermore, there are multiple accessibility concerns that result
          from examinig this website.
          <br><br>
          The WebAIM WAVE tool revealed that there are missing page titles
          and headers, along with unclear page regions, 
          which make the website difficult to navigate.
          There is also no language preset, which allows webpages to load
          faster and helps search engines properly categorize it.
          The text is also quite small and many areas of text contrast 
          poorly with the background color, which greatly hinder readability.
          <br><br>
          After using a screenreader on this website, I noticed that many 
          things do not have descriptors and make it difficult to navigate.
          For example, the contact information (address and phone number) 
          are written without descriptors, so it is difficult to know both
          that the screenreader is beginning to read an address and to tell 
          where the end of the zip code and the beginning of the phone number is.
          There are also asterisks in random places to denote emphasis on 
          a seemingly arbitrary set of items, and there is no alternative 
          texts for images.

          Aside: Personally, I have always found shopping websites that 
          obscured the prices to feel almost distrustful. I would take longer 
          to try to find the price, and also would wonder if making this 
          purchase was reasonable if it feels like even the company 
          would like you to forget how much it costs.

          For this test, the link, which had an equal chance of dispalying

          Without knowing which version they received, they played the part 
          of a typical user and used the site to add $150 worth of cacti 
          products to their cart.

          <ul class="takeaways">
            <li>The sample size of A/B testing is very important in finding 
              statistically significant results with small changes. 
              After running this test, I feel like I have a better understanding 
              of the advantage in resources that big industries have 
              and how much harder it must be to collect data and improve your 
              interface using A/B testing when there is low traffic to your site.
            </li>
            <li>Using statistical tests allows for a controlled method of 
              evaluating results. From the data, I would personally have guessed
              that version A had a lower return rate than version B, since 
              only 1/3 of people returned to the main page in version A but 
              1/2 of people returned to the main page in version B. However, 
              with such a small sample, the p-value was much larger than 
              0.05, and therefore I could not reject the null hypothesis.
            </li>
            <li>A/B testing reveals how metadata can be incredibly revealing 
              about users and their experience with a website. 
              For example, just seeing that the same user returned to a 
              webpage quickly after leaving, or how long it took them to 
              make their first click on the page actually reveals more than 
              normal people might expect. 
              This data is incredibly useful and powerful given how trivial 
              it may seem at first.

        <div class="p">
          I had a really fun time working on a redesign for a public website. 
          I think I was able to learn a lot from prototyping and from 
          creating a style guide. Along the way, I noticed that each  
          step was instrumental in preparing me for the next part.
          I noticed sometimes though, that I would spend a long time 
          deliberating margins and padding, and I also can understand how editing
          small design things can really pull you in and steal focus.
          This is something I hope to work on in the future.
          I was also able to have a lot more practice with flexbox 
          when creating a responsive site, and I worked with JavaScript 
          and jquery to resolve my side navigation bar issue when the 
          font sized increased.
